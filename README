mui
-----------------------------------------------------------

mui is a UI library that is designed following the principe
that only 3 type of element can be rendered on a window.
These types are :

   1. Text
   2. Shapes
   3. Images

The goal of this design is to keep the codebase as small 
as possible. Hence, as maintainable as possible.

Additional features must be done by the developer using 
mui.

Right now the only fully working platform is OpenBSD.
Further efforts will be done to include FreeBSD as well
as NetBSD.
